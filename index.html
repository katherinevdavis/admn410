<p><b>History:</b> The Durham House of Pets has been around since 2008. It was founded by Katherine Davis, who had always been a pet lover and wanted a shop where she could get all she needed for her pets close to home. Katherine lives in Durham and thought this would be the greatest investment she could have ever done. Since 2008, the store has grown. Starting with just treats and food, to now toys, pet apparel and various necessities that any animal would need. </p>
